@article{AmorimNetoStrom2006,
	Annote = {SUBSTANTIVE
	
	Question: What is the effect of semi-presidential systems on the number
	of non-partisan cabinet ministers? Goal: Offer and test a formal
	theory of the appointment of cabinet ministers in parliamentiary
	and semi-presidential systems. Theory: They lay out a formal theory
	where the actors differ in their prefernces for redistribution but
	value efficiency similarly. They key parameters are the president's
	cost of dissolution, the prime minister's probability of relection,
	and the value both place on efficiency. The model is driven by a
	tradeoff between redistribution (partisan member in cabinet) and
	efficiency (non-partisans in cabinet). Concepts: Nothing really profound
	here. Unit of analysis: A government formation attempt. Actors: The
	president and the prime minister Implications: They lay out a formal
	theory where the proportion of non-partisan cabinet ministers decreases
	with the president's cost of dissolution and the prime minister's
	probability of relection, and increases with the value of non-partisan
	experts. 
	
	METHODOLOGICAL
	
	Implications tested: The share of non-partisan cabinet ministers will
	be greater: 1.) under cohabitation (divided goverment). 2.) when
	there is high electoral volatility. 3.) the greater the number of
	cabinent parties. 4.) under minority government. 5.) under lower
	legislative fragmentation. 6.) when the economy is good. 7.) under
	semi-presidential rules. 8.) under a more powerful president. Empirical
	strategy: A series of extended-beta binomial models (see King 1989
	pp. 45-48) Test adequacy: I wonder if the observation across time
	are really independent. They include fixed effects, but I do not
	know if this properly accounts for the time dependence, but it seems
	like this is the standard approach. I think that a multilevel model
	might be more interesting. Measurement validity: I wonder if electoral
	volatility actually captures the prime minister's likelihood of reelection.
	Maybe. Key IV(s): See Hypotheses above DV: Proportion of non-partisan
	cabinet ministers Case selection: Europe 1990-200, include purely
	parliamentary and semi-presidential systems. Exclude others, and
	FH ``not free, and those which data is unavailable.
	
	FINDINGS
	
	They find fairly strong support for their idea that semi-presidentialism
	boosts the number of non-partisans in the cabinent. Their hypothesis
	that more cabinet parties increases the number of non-partisans is
	not supported. In fact, they find the opposite.},

	Question: Do more proportional electoral institutions lead to increased
	turnout? Goal: Explain why we wee higher turnout under proportional
	systems? DV: aggregate turnout IV(s): CV election system Theory:
	Several possible explanations presented. 1 - Increase individual-level
	political efficacy by making it more likely that a single vote, especially
	a vote for a minority party, matters. (The authors don't say it,
	but it seems that this should or might come from mobilization). 2
	- Contested elections lead to greater elite mobilization of voters,
	and thus, increased turnout. (The authors cite Cox 1999 "Electoral
	Rules and the Calculus of Mobilization") Concepts: Nothing too deep
	here Unit of analysis: United States counties Actors in the theory:
	Political elites Implications of the theory: Obviously, higher turnout
	under CV. Also, increased mobilization efforts under CV. It seems
	that scholars should consider who is likely to be mobilized. Different
	groups are not likely to be mobilized at the same rates.
	
	METHODOLOGICAL
	
	Tested implications: Turnout should be higher under CV. Note that
	this is a well-known empirical phenomenon, but the causal mechanism
	is not well-understood. If this implication holds, we learn nothing
	new, only reaffirm that proportional electoral systems lead to increased
	turnout, something that is already well-documented. Empirical strategy:
	OLS regression with a CV-dummy and a few controls. Also a time-series
	section to see if a change in the rules leads to a change in turnout.
	Data: County-level turnout data Adequate test: Seems so Valid measures:
	Nothing too complicated here. Case selection: All CV counties in
	the US matched with other counties
	
	FINDINGS
	
	The authors find that CV counties have higher turnout than SMD counties.
	They also find that counties see higher turnout after adopting CV
	rules, both in the next election and over a longer period.

	Barry and Hartigan's approach and offer a new R package, pkgbcp (Erdman

	alternatives to the Bayesian analysis, the recursive circular binary
	segmentation algorithm (Olshen and Venkatraman 2004) and the dynamic
	programming algorithm of (Bai and Perron 2003). We illustrate the
	application of bcp with economic and microarray data from the literature.

@article{Ferejohn1986,
	Annote = {THEORY PAPER (no empirical test)
	
	Prior work assumes that candidates implement their strategies when
	in office. The author argues that this makes little sense and tries
	``to construct a coherent model in which voters have an incentive
	to base their choices on behavior of officeholders and in which officeholders
	choose their strategies in anticipation of this behavior. In this
	model, voters pay no attention to campaign promises. They only judge
	the incumbent performance.
	
	Set-up of the model
	
	1.) Ferejohn makes the curious choice to formulate the model with
	an infinite time horizon so that last-period effects are avoided
	and the model does not unravel. Justified by saying that political
	parties solve this problem, since they last indefinitely.
	
	2.) The model assumes assymetric information. The public cannot observe
	the politicians behavior directly.
	
	3.) Single voter.
	
	4.) Voters assume that all candidates are of equal competence
	
	5.) Voters judge performance, which is a combination of policy and
	exogenous occurences.
	
	The development of the model itself is pretty mathematically dense
	and not casually readable or easily summarized.
	
	KEY RESULTS
	
	When a set of challengers is available to assume office and the electorate
	is able to act in a unitary fashion, then the electorate can control
	the elected officials. When the electorate is unable to act in a
	unitary fashion, they are completely unable to control the politician.
	To the extent that voters are able to use sociotropic rather than
	egocentric voting then politicians are better controlled.
	
	Interesting NOTE: When combined with the implications of hetergenous
	attribution theory, and some basic findings in the turnout literature,
	this seems to suggest that a less sophisticated electorate would
	better hold politicians accountable. That is a little bit counter-intuitive.},

	In this article, the author simply lays out five areas where the research
	on political tolerance should procede. He discusses each in some
	detail. See the article for those details.
	
	1.) Threat, a key explanatory variable in models of tolerance, has
	received very little attention as an outcome variable.
	
	2.) The multidimensionality of threat (i.e. collective versus personal)
	has received little attention although they seem to have different
	effects on tolerance.
	
	3.) The fact that social and political intolerance seem unrelated
	has received little attention.
	
	4.) More work needs to be done on how scholars measure intolerance.
	Current technology is the least-liked technique.
	
	5.) The differenct effects of tolerant and intolerant attitudes on
	behavior has not been investigated.},

@article{Gibson1988,

	Question: What are the effects of mass and elite intolerance on public
	policy? Goal: ``this research is designed as an empirical test of
	the policy implications of the widespread intolerance that seems
	to characterize teh political culture of the United States. Theory:
	Elitest democratic theory asserts that policy is protective of political
	minorities because it reflects the preferences of elites, preferences
	that tend to be more tolerant than those of the mass public. Repression
	flows from the demands of an activated mass public. Concepts: Repressive
	public policy - statutory restriction on oppositionist political
	activity. Political tolerance - the willingness of citiens to support
	the extension of rights of citizenship to all members of the polity,
	that is, to allow political freedoms to those who are politically
	different. Unit of Analysis: State DV: An index of political repression
	in the states IV(s): Elite opinion and mass opinion.
	
	METHODOLOGICAL
	
	Implications tested: Mass intolerance should have a positive and significant
	effect on the adoption of repressive policies. Elite intolerance
	should not be related. (Indeed, the theory assumes that elite tolerance
	does not vary and that elites are always tolerant.) Emprical strategy:
	Simple linear regression, correlations, and some tabular data. Test
	adequacy: The methods are quite simple but I think that the results
	the author argues makes sense. However, the author seems to miss
	the point that elites are intolerant and that this violates a fundamental
	assumption of the authors description of elitist democratic theory.
	The theory doesn't seem to tell us anything about what happens when
	the elites are intolerant. Therefore, this doesn't seem to be a real
	test of the theory. Measurement validity: The author's measure of
	mass tolerance in the states could be greatly improved it seems by
	adopting the ``Lax and Philips'' approach to estimating state-level
	opinion. The author does not describe the error in the estimates
	and probably doesn't account for it in any way. This is a reasonable
	approach though. The treatment of elite opinion is more problematic.
	The author admits that he has a small, nonrandom sample of elites
	that might not represent elite opinion. Further, the error associated
	with this measure is much greater (both in the variance and the mean).
	However, one would think that the greater measurement error in the
	elite measure would reduce its effect, since that is what increased
	random measurement error does. However, we see the exact opposite
	effect in the model. Elite opinion, which should have a reduced effect
	due to increased measurement error has a huge effect compared to
	mass opinion, which is measured more precisely. Case selection: Stouffer
	data. Focuses on the red scare. As I mentioned above, this is not
	an appropriate test case for the theory the author presents because
	that theory explains the effect of mass intolerance when elites are
	tolerant.
	
	FINDINGS
	
	The author finds that elite opinion, not mass opinion, creates repressive
	public policy.},

	Annote = {Goal: ``to understand how the political context affects the decision
	to use statutes to limit agency discretion. (p. 44)" Variation: Some
	statutes are detailed, others are vague. 
	
	CHAPTER 3 (Measuring legislation)
	
	Systematically examines statutes.
	
	A. Policy Instructions 
	
	I. General Policy Language (actually small part of most statutes)
	II. Client Categories 1. defining participants 2. nature of coverage
	3. client participation III. Provider Categories 1. selection of
	providers 2. provider responsibilities and rights 3. paying providers
	IV. Misc. Categories 1. definitions 2. quality asssurance 3. financial
	4. privatization
	
	B. Nonpolicy (procedural) Instructions
	
	I. ex ante Controls 1. Information Requirements 2. Proposal Requirements
	3. Study Requirements II. ex post controls 1. Reporting Requirement
	2. Appeals Process III. Agent Controls 1. Committees a. nonlegislative
	b. legislative 2. Staffing Requirements 3. Creation of new agency
	or dept. IV. General Procedural Control
	
	In the cross-national part of the study, the authors are simply searching
	for patterns similar to the state level analysis. The coding and
	analysis is much less fine for the cross-national data.
	
	Key points:
	
	1. length serves as a useful proxy for agency constraint for statutes
	addressing the same issue 2. procedures play a minimal role in most
	statutes 3. these patterns are similar in the state and cross-national
	data.
	
	CHAPTER 4 (Theory)
	
	Two actors: politicians and bureaucrats - policy preferences of each
	may diverge - bureaucrat is better informed - designing a statute
	is costly to the politician - bureaucrats chooses whether or not
	to implement policy
	
	Stages 1. Politician chooses whether or not to adopt legislation which
	specifies boudaries on the bureaucrats actions 2. The bureaucrat
	chooses which policy to implement 3. Political system responds
	
	Key Results 1. As conflict and legislative capacity increase, low-discretion
	statutes increase 2. The effect should be interactive if a large
	number of states have insufficient leg. capacity, but direct if a
	large number of states have high leg. capacity. [I completely don't
	understand how this makes any sense. Capacity seems to be a necessary
	condition for low-discretion statutes. This is modeled through a
	interaction always.] 3. As nonstatutory factors become more useful
	to politicians, low-discretion legislation diecreases. 4. These are
	true in parliamentary and presidential systems 5. In presidential
	systems, bicameral conflict leads to more discretion.
	
	
	CHAPTER 7 (Empirical test with cross-national data)
	
	They have a really weird model on p. 200. I am not sure why they standardize
	the dependent variable. This makes the results difficult to interpret
	(and even impossible since we do not know the what function theta
	is, only some of it properties). It might be the typical way to estimate
	these random effects model, but it seems quite strange. I don't know
	why they just don't have a standard regression with an intercept
	that varies across countries. },

	Question: Does increased political efficacy explain higher political
	participation in PR systems? Goal: Explain higher participation in
	PR systems. Theory: This paper proposes four effects of systems on
	the decision to vote. (1) Plurality systems, through disproportionality,
	discourage supporters of minor parties (a loss of efficacy) and depress
	their participation. Parties might alter their own behavior for a
	similar reason. (2) A greater number of parties increases the likelihood
	of a coalition government, which depresses participation, and increases
	participation by allowing more parties to mobilize and attract voters.
	(3) Parties are more likely to adopt distinct ideological positions
	under PR rules. In systems with extreme parties, voters will adopt
	stronger partisan attachment. (4) These effects varies depending
	on the party the voter is attracted to. Large party supporters are
	not discouraged from voting in plurality systems. Concepts: Nothing
	new here. Unit of analysis: Individual Actors: Individuals making
	the decision, and elites choosing the extent of mobilization Implications:
	Seem to directly test the theory, although they test the mechanism
	(efficacy). DV(s): efficacy, turnout decision IV(s):Effective number
	of parties, parties in government, preference for small party, disproportionality,
	strength of preference, efficacy (all of these variables have an
	indirect effect through efficacy and all but preference for small
	party have a direct effect as well).
	
	METHODOLOGICAL
	
	Implications tested: (1) The number of parties in government has a
	negative effect on efficacy. (2) The number of effective parties
	in parliament has a postive effect on efficacy and participation.
	(3) The strength of party preference has a positive effect on efficacy.
	Empirical strategy: Multilevel models Test adequacy: Seems to work.
	Measurement validity: OK Case selection: CSES
	
	FINDINGS
	
	1.) Citizens who prefer small parties exhibit less efficacy. These
	effect incease as the system become more disproportional. 2.) Strength
	of party preference positively effects efficacy and voting. 3.) Number
	of parties in goverment negatively effects efficacy.

	the the lower the number of women in a group, the less that women
	participate in and influence it, and the bigger the gender gap is
	in participation and influence. We call this the ``gender role'' hypothesis
	
	 The gender role hypothesis implies that effects will be especially
	pronounced when the gender imbalance in deliberating groups is extreme.
	
	 At the opposite end of the spectrum, the gender role hypothesis leads
	to the expectation that women will flourish in all-female settings.
	
	 Formally stated, our interaction hypothesis is that a significant
	interaction between gen- der composition and decision rule exists:
	The gender gap in speech and influence favoring men decreases as
	the number of women increases under majority rule; the gender gap
	in speech and influence favoring men increases as the number of women
	increases under unanimous rule.},

	Question: Some scholars suggest that citizens are uninformed about
	politics, but are they actually misinformed? Goal: Describe misinformation
	relating to U.S. welfare facts. Theory: Psychologial - People tend
	to draw social inferences, seek attitude consistency, and be overconfident
	in their beliefs. Concepts: Not only informed and uninformed, but
	also misinformed. Unit of analysis: Individual Actors: Psychological
	DV: Misinformation and confindence in it / policy references IV(s):
	Misinformation
	
	METHODOLOGICAL
	
	Implications tested: Not any real Empirical strategy: Three randomized
	groups: one receives facts about welfare, the second receives questions
	about welfare, the third (control) receives neither. Test adequacy:
	Not good, but the authors present the paper as speculative rather
	than conclusive. Measurement validity: Maybe people just aren't good
	with math. Case selection: Representative sample of Illinois residents
	
	FINDINGS
	
	People are misinformed about welfare. The errors are skewed toward
	opposing welfare. Although through several treatments receiving facts
	did not make people more likely to support welfare, the authors created
	an "in your face" treatment that did. If the respondents were asked
	a factual policy question, asked what the answer should be, told
	the correct answer, and later polled on their policy preferences.
	These respondents seem to respond to the new information.},

	Annote = {This is a measurement paper.
	
	Motivation: Most public opinion and political behavior research relies
	on valid measures of political knowledge. This paper looks specifically
	at the construction of knowledge batteries, as these have been shown
	to be the best way to measure knowledge, but little research has
	examined their construction.
	
	I. Knowledge batteries tend to encourgage "Don't Know" responses.
	A. Informing respondents that DKs are welcome prior to battery. B.
	Informing respondents that DKs are welcome during the question. C.
	Interviewers do not prompt after uncertainty. D. Short answer format,
	rather than multiple choice II. Thus knowledge batteries reflect
	knowledge and propensity to guess, but this can be neutralized by
	"forcing" all respondents to guess. III. Data A. Split ballots1.
	First version encourages DKs, as usual2. Second version discouraged
	DKs. B. 1998 NES Pilot C. Tallahassee survey IV. Respondents continue
	to reply DK, but at a much lower rate. Mondak suggests that this
	can be fixed by randomly assigning DKs a "guess." V. Problems with
	open-ended items (opposed to multiple choice). A. Response sets are
	particularly common. B. Correction (through a post-hoc random guess)
	is not available. C. Subjective scoring D. Restrict subject matter
	to basic facts

	Question: Motivation: Information allows citizens to hold politicians
	accountable and the distribution of information affects the distribution
	of political power. Goal: To show that traditional measures of knowledge
	underestimate the amount of knowledge that respondents have. Theory:
	Respondents have knowledge in declarative memory and also have procedural
	knowledge. Traditional knowledge batteries fail to effectively measure
	the amount of both held by respondents. Concepts: Declarative memory
	- effort required to recall Procedural memory - in this case, knowing
	where to find information Unit of analysis: Individual Actors: Psychologial
	Implications: Respondents with greater incentives or time will recall
	more information DV: Number of correct responses IV(s): Pay, time
	
	METHODOLOGICAL
	
	Implications tested: 1.Providing an incentive for correctly answering
	knowledge questions will not affect the likelihood of offering a
	correct answer. 2.Ability to answer question quickly and given time
	will not be sufficiently different to require separate measurement.
	
	Empirical strategy: Experimentally manipulate two aspects of a typically
	survey interview. First, the respondents are given an incentive to
	answer correctly. Second, the respondents are given more time to
	answer questions. Test adequacy: The first experiment seems great.
	The second seems to confound "procedural memory" with time to search
	and incentive to search. For example, older people do well when given
	more time. Is this because they have great skills or the time to
	search for answers? I also wish the authors had reported the number
	of refusals in each condition. Measurement validity: I am not sure
	the authors are measuring "procedural memory" very well. Case selection:
	Knowledge Networks nationally representative sample.
	
	FINDINGS
	
	Given greater time and incentives, respondents call recall more about
	politics. Incentives tend to widen the knowledge gap, while time
	seems to narrow it.},

	Question: What are the effects of institutional-features on the durability
	of governments? Goal: Test hypotheses Theory: They have stories,
	but borrow mainly from other literature and intuition. Concepts:
	Nothing new Unit of analysis: The government Actors: National political
	actors such as the PM, president, and parliament Implications: DV:
	survival time of a government in days and failure type (electoral
	or non-electoral) IV(s): the premier's initiative to dissolve, constrained
	dissolution, president's discretion to to disolve assembly, president's
	power to dismiss the government.
	
	METHODOLOGICAL
	
	Implications tested: (1) Prime ministerial control of dissolution
	makes early elections more likely (compared to cabinet or majority-controlled
	disolution). (2) Constrained dissolutions (need overwhelming parliamentary
	support, president's approval, or several failed investitures) lower
	the risk of early termination (compared to cabinet- or majority-dissolution).
	(3) Presidential control of dissolution lowers the risk of early
	elections compared to prime ministerial control. (4) When dissolution
	is constrained, the likelihood of non-electoral replacement increases.
	(5) Presidential dissolution power makes the both early elections
	and non-electoral termination more likely.
	
	Empirical Strategy: Cox proportional hazards with competing risks
	and shared (country-level) frailties. Test adequacy: Cox seems to
	be the dominant trend, but their model assumes that risks are uncorrelated
	Measurement validity: Measures work for me Case selection: Strom's
	West European data supplemented with original East European data.
	
	FINDINGS
	
	1.) Semi-presidential regimes do no produce less durable governments.
	2.) Many constitutions make opportunistic election-calling difficult.
	3.) The literature on political business cycles should consider the
	constitutional structure.

	Question: Does increased competition lead to greater participation
	in PR systems? Goal: Explain why we observe higher turnout in PR
	systems. Theory: Borrows from Cox (1999), the "pivotal elites model."
	Parties observe that resources are well-spent in some districts,
	but "wasted" in others. This leads to great variation in the mobilization
	efforts of parties acorss districts in SMD systems. PR systems on
	the other hand are competed for in larger districts, giving parties
	the incentive to mobilize all citizens. Concepts: Nothing to deep
	here Unit of analysis: District Actors: parties and citizens who
	respond Implications: higher turnout in more competitive districts,
	greater variation in turnout across districts in SMD systems. DV:
	turnout, district level IV(s): threshold of exclusion, district margin
	
	METHODOLOGICAL
	
	Implications tested: (1) Greater turnout in closer elections, (2)
	mobilization and turnout more variable in SMD systems, (3) no difference
	between PR and SMD, competitiveness held constant, (4) ower turnout
	with higher threshold of exclusion, and (5-7) suprdistrict corrections
	produce higher turnout, weaker effect of competitiveness, lower cross-district
	variation. Empirical strategy: Mixed Heteroskedastic Logit. It seems
	that given lower turnout in SMD systems, the variation cannot help
	but be greater. It seems that the structure of the systems themselves
	might be producing these results. It seems like he could have the
	causal arrow backward. Test adequecy: I don't know enough about this
	model to say. Measurement validity: I am not sure that his construct
	of district competitiveness makes much sense. I need to at least
	think about this some more. Case selection: CSES data
	
	FINDINGS
	
	The observed difference in turnout is due to local competition.

	Question: Goals: (1) guage the extent to which concerns over cultural
	and economic integration now drive reactions to immigrants and immigration
	in Western Europe and (2) show how the dynamics of public responses
	to political issues follow from the interplay of two sets of factors,
	predisposing concerns and situational triggers. Theory: Two competing
	theories, realistic conflict and social identity. Realistic competition
	focuses on the key variable of economic competition and social identity
	explanations focus on group membership. Implications: ``Given the
	perceptual distinctiveness, salience, and entativity of immigrant
	minoirties in THE Netherlands, the impact of conflicting cultural
	identies should fall toward the higher end of its range of influence.''
	Concepts: The authors discuss and even include in their title the
	concepts of predisposing factors and situational triggers, but do
	not seem to ever define or discuss these ideas. Actors: Individuals
	Unit of analysis: Individual DV: Questions guaging exclusionary reaction

	 Hypothesis 1 (H1) embodies the override mechanism: ``The more credible

	favor of the governments' favored position'' (CGH 439).
	
	 ** Interesting comment: Although H1 implies, and rightly so, that
	the threat of override would be credi- ble only when a ``sufficiently
	large coalition'' of MSGs weighs in, CGH treat the threat as present
	even in cases when only one MSG, which might be as small as Luxembourg
	or Portugal, has filed a brief in favor of a defendant member state.
	This move conflicts with the precepts of intergovernmentalism, which
	predicts that only powerful states can constrain the court (e.g.,
	Garrett 1992).**
	
	 Hypothesis 2 (H2) embodies their approach to non- compliance: ``The
	more opposition a litigant govern- ment has from other MSGs, the
	more likely the court is to rule against that litigant government''
	(439).

	Abstract = {{To explain the gender gap in legislatures, scholars have identified
	several socioeconomic, political, and cultural factors that undermine
	women's representation. One explanation focuses on electoral institutions.
	Proportional representation systems with higher district magnitudes
	have been shown to increase the percentage of women in legislatures.
	The authors contend that solely concentrating on district magnitude
	ignores other critical electoral rules that will affect women's representation.
	To better understand electoral system effects, scholars must understand
	how electoral rules beside district magnitude create incentives for
	candidates to obtain personal votes. The authors argue that those
	systems with weak incentives for personal votes (party-centered systems)
	increase women's representation in comparison with systems that feature
	strong incentives for personal votes (candidate-centered systems).
	Using a data set of 57 countries between 1980 and 2005, the authors
	show that party-centered systems are more conducive to women's representation.}},
